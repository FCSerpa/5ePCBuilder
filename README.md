# 5ePCBuilder
MEAN stack app to build characters for the 5th edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons game.

The character creation functionality is about 75% there for a basic character, and I still have to make some of the CRUD actions work.  A basic character being from the options in Wizards of the Coast's free basic rules PDF.  I would like to find a way to include more options in the builder without giving out Wizards' intellecual property, and I have some ideas for that, specifically I'm thinking about making custom options so users can input the info from the rulebooks they've payed for and the appropriate modifiers will still populate throughout the site.

and here's a link to the site on heroku, but I had some issues with deploying (probably my asset pipeline), and my images adn fonts aren't quite working properly, so that's on my to-do list as well-
